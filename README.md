#  Code Challenge - Coffee Shop
## Overview
This project simulates a simple coffee shop management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It includes three main classes:

- Customer
- Coffee
- Order

The relationships between these models are as follows:

- A Customer can have multiple Orders.
- A Coffee can be part of multiple Orders.
- An Order is associated with both a Customer and a Coffee.

## Features
- **Customer Management:** Create and manage customers, track their orders, and identify the customer who has spent the most on a specific coffee.
- **Coffee Management:** Create coffee types, track orders for each coffee, and calculate the number of orders and average price for each coffee.
- **Order Management:** Link customers and coffee with a price, ensuring data integrity and enabling various queries.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text).
